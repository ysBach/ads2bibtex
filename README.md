# ads2bibtex
Make **ADS library auto-synchronized to the local file** (recommeneded: BibTeX).


## Purpose
I created this script to reduce the time I waste on creating BibTeX files for multiple journals and my thesis. I did **not** care about the usage when the journals do not support BibTeX, and that's why the name is `ads2bibtex`. However, this should generally be useful because ADS supports various output formats (See Usage Tips below).

Also, it is intended to be **run in the background** on my terminal while I crawl references on ADS. When I [add a paper to my library on ADS](http://adsabs.github.io/help/libraries/creating-libraries), this script automatically detects the change by checking the *last-modified timestamp* and updates the local BibTeX file accordingly.


## First Step (One Time)

**Installation**: clone this repo and

    $ pip install -e .

Later, you may `git pull`. Currently `pip install ads2bibtex` is unavailable (to be available 2023 Fall)

* Go to [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)
* Top right: `Log In`. After logging in...
* Top right: `Account` â†’ `Settings`
* Left: `API Token`

Do **NOT** click `Generate a new key` unless you really need it!!

<details><summary><b>How do I make an ADS Library?</b> (click)</summary>

* Top right: `Account` â†’ `ADS Libraries`
* Left: `ADD A LIBRARY` â†’ Set the name of the library (e.g., "PhDT", "everything", "Bach+2023AJ").
* Select `Manage Access` Tab â†’ copy `Library ID`: ``https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/<Library ID>``

See [this](http://adsabs.github.io/help/libraries/creating-libraries) to learn how to add a paper to your library on ADS.

## First Usage

1. To get all help messages:
    ```
    ads2bibtex -h
    ```

2. The simplest usage:
    ```
    ads2bibtex <library ID> -o ysBach_PhDT_SNU/references.bib
    ```
* *NOTE*: Paste your API token if asked. It will be saved as `.ads-token` file for later use.
* *NOTE*: To update the token, simply `rm .ads-token`.

This then downloads entry as bibtex, using ADS default format (bibtex).

For **different journals/formats other than BibTeX**, use `-f` (see `ads2bibtex -h`).

## Usage Tips
### "Additional" Entry
There are things that are **not registered to ADS**. If you have an additional file for them:

    ads2bibtex <library ID> -a bib_add.txt -o outputdir/references.bib

<details><summary>Contents of my <code>bib_add.txt</code> as an example (click)</summary>
<p>
I always use `-f bibtex` as default. Thus, my "additional file" is in BibTeX format:

```
% A part of my own bib_add.txt
@ARTICLE{2022_SAG_NICpolpy,
       author = {{Bach}, Yoonsoo P. and {Ishiguro}, Masateru and {Takahashi}, Jun and {Geem}, Jooyeon},
        title = "{Data Reduction Process and Pipeline for the NIC Polarimetry Mode in Python, NICpolpy}",
      journal = {Stars and Galaxies (arXiv:2212.14167)},
     keywords = {methods: data analysis, methods: observational, techniques: image processing, techniques: polarimetric},
         year = 2022,
        month = dec,
       volume = {5},
          eid = {4},
        pages = {4},
archivePrefix = {arXiv},
       eprint = {2212.14167},
 primaryClass = {astro-ph.IM},
       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221214167B},
      adsnote = {}
}

@INPROCEEDINGS{gil-hutton-data,
title= {Catalogue of asteroid polarization curves},
author = {Gil-Hutton, R.},
year = {2017},
booktitle= {ACM (Asteroid, Comets, Meteors) 2017, Montevideo},
pages={Poster1.d.17},
URL= {http://gcpsj.sdf-eu.org/catalogo.html},
       adsurl = {},
      adsnote = {}
}
```

</p>
</details>

* **Important Note**: The journal names in the additional file (`-a`, `--additional-file`) will **also be changed** based on `-j` (`--journal`) option.
* **Important Note**: Note that "full journal name â†’ ADS MACRO" is designed to be impossible (why not use ADS entry?). To simply append the additional file to the resulting BibTeX without altering `journal` field, use `-j ads` option, which is the default.


### Journal Names
You want the **full name** of the journals? Use `-j full` to make ``\apj`` â†’ ``Astrophysicial Journal``:

    ads2bibtex <library ID> -o outputdir/references.bib -j full

You want **ISO4 style**? You need to install `nltk` and use `-j iso4` to make ``\apj`` â†’ ``Astrophys. J.``:

    ads2bibtex <library ID> -o outputdir/references.bib -j iso4

These are useful for, e.g., non-astronomy specific journals like Nature/Science (or even thesis).


### Less Useful Functionalities
Some tips for other arguments (use ``ads2bibtex -h`` for full help)
* ``-n`` (``-num-iter``): number of iterations (default=500)
  * **Warning**: Although I could not find the description, ADS "**limits users to 5000 requests/day (on a rolling 24-hour window)**", and there is no way to circumvent this limit [Lockhart, K. 2023-03-07, priv. comm. via email through help desk].
* ``-t`` (``--dtime``): time between iterations (default=5s)
* ``-i`` (``--info-interval``): number of iterations between info prints (default=20)

<details><summary>For debugging purpose...</summary>
<p>

If you want to save a separate output as *ADS-Export* functionality as ``bib_raw.txt`` for some reason (for me, I made it purely for debugging purpose):

    ads2bibtex <library ID> -r bib_raw.txt -o outputdir/references.bib

Use ``-f`` or ``-F`` (``--format`` or ``--format-raw``) to set the save style of output file and raw file, respectively. By default, ``-f`` is ``"bibtex"`` and ``-F`` is ``%R  # %3h_%Y_%q_%V_%p %T`` (a random testing format I used for debugging).

    ads2bibtex <library ID> -r bib_raw.txt -o outputdir/references.bib -F "%R  # %10.5N_%Y_%q_%V_%p %T"

This is the same as ADS's "Export â†’ Custom Format". See [this help page](http://adsabs.github.io/help/actions/export) of ADS.

## Requirements
- `regex` (also used in `nltk` https://pypi.org/project/regex/)
- `colorama` (for colorful output on terminal)

To use abbreviation of words (``-j iso4``), you need `nltk`.


## Other Notes
### TODO?
At the moment, you cannot change the original journal name into the ADS style macro. (macro -> full/iso4 is possible).

### `iso4`
The `iso4/` is directly adopted from [`adlpr/iso4`](https://github.com/adlpr/iso4) (MIT license), and underwent minor tweaks to cope with the more recent LTWA version.

### Notes by ADS
ADS provides some example notes:
* [GitHub](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api)
* [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/tree/master/)

Explanations are scattered to many places, such as:
* [Full API Docs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/api-docs.html#auth)
* [Export API](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/blob/master/Export_API.ipynb)
* [Search API](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/blob/master/Search_API.ipynb): this explains most of the APIs I guess.

### Bugs
* I sometimes encounter a crash. However, I can just re-run the script and then everything is fine ðŸ¤·
